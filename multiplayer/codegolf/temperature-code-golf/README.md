# Temperatures \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/codegolf/temperature-code-golf)\]
## Problem Description:
It's freezing cold out there! Will you be able to find the temperature closest to zero in a set of temperatures readings?
 


  The Goal
----------



In this exercise, you have to analyze records of temperature to find the closest to zero.  

  

You need to solve this puzzle using as little characters as possible.

Sample temperatures
Here, -1 is the closest to 0.





  Rules
-------



Write a program that prints the temperature closest to 0 among input data. **If two numbers are equally close to zero, positive integer has to be considered closest to zero** (for instance, if the temperatures are -5 and 5, then display 5).




  Game Input
------------




Your program must read the data from the standard input and write the result on the standard output.



Input

Line 1:  N, the number of temperatures to analyze


Line 2:  The N temperatures expressed as integers ranging from -273 to 5526






Output
Display 0 (zero) if no temperatures are provided. Otherwise, display the temperature closest to 0.



Constraints
0 ≤ N < 10000



Example



Input

```

5
1 -2 -8 4 5
```



Output

```

1
```
