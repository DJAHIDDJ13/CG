# Shadows of the Knight - Episode 1 \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/shadows-of-the-knight-episode-1)\]
## Problem Description:
<i>NA NA NA NA NA BATMAN</i><br>
We love Batman's adventures : The Joker, bombs, hostages, and a hero. But this time, it is you who are the hero. Your job is to find the bombs before they explode! Don't worry, Alfred's got you covered, he's handed you a heat detector set to recognize the thermal signature of the Joker's bombs. Easy? Let's find out.
<br>
<br>
<u>Topic</u> : Convergence.<br>
<br>
<i>This medium puzzle is the first of the two exercises proposed for the challenge «&nbsp;Shadows of the Knight&nbsp;». Once you have completed it, why not try to solve the next one «&nbsp;Triangulation&nbsp;», on the same theme but with an increased difficulty.</i>
 


  The Goal
----------


You will look for the hostages on a given building by jumping from one window to another using your grapnel gun. Your goal is to jump to the window where the hostages are located in order to disarm the bombs. Unfortunately, you have a limited number of jumps before the bombs go off...



  Rules
-------



Before each jump, the heat-signature device will provide you with the direction of the bombs based on your current position: 
* U (Up)
* UR (Up-Right)
* R (Right)
* DR (Down-Right)
* D (Down)
* DL (Down-Left)
* L (Left)
* UL (Up-Left)


  

Your mission is to program the device so that **it indicates the location of the next window you should jump to** in order to reach the bombs' room **as soon as possible**.  

  

Buildings are represented as a rectangular array of windows, the window in the **top left corner of the building is at index (0,0)**.




  Note
------


For some tests, **the bombs' location may change from one execution to the other**: the goal is to help you find the best algorithm in all cases.  

  

The tests provided are similar to the validation tests used to compute the final score but remain different.



  Game Input
------------




The program must first read the initialization data from standard input. Then, within an infinite loop, read the device data from the standard input and provide to the standard output the next movement instruction.



Initialization input

Line 1 :  2 integers W H. The (W, H) couple represents the width and height of the building as a number of windows.


Line 2 :  1 integer N, which represents the number of jumps you can make before the bombs go off.


Line 3 :  2 integers X0 Y0, representing your starting position.






Input for one game turn
The direction indicating where the bomb is.


Output for one game turn
A single line with 2 integers X Y separated by a space character. (X, Y) represents the location of the next window you should jump to. X represents the index along the horizontal axis, Y represents the index along the vertical axis. (0,0) is located in the top-left corner of the building.



Constraints
1 ≤ W ≤ 10000  

1 ≤ H ≤ 10000  

2 ≤ N ≤ 100  

0 ≤ X, X0 < W  

0 ≤ Y, Y0 < H  

Response time per turn ≤ 150ms  

Response time per turn ≤ 150ms



Example



Initialization input

```

10 10     *Building has 100 windows (10x10)*
6         *You have 6 jumps to find the bombs*
2 5       *You start at position (2,5)*

```

*You found the hostages. You can defuse the bombs in time. You win!*
