# Next growing number \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/next-growing-number)\]


Â Goal
-----


A growing number is a number where each digit, from left to right, is greater than or equal to the previous one.  
  
Given a number n, which may or may not be a growing number, you have to find the first growing number > n.  
  
**Example:**   
With **n = 19**, the first growing number greater than n is **22**, because both **20** and **21** have a second digit that is smaller than the first one.  
   
**Note:** This problem can be solved without converting n to a number.



Input
**line 1:** a string representing the number n


Output
**line 1:** the first growing number > n


Constraints
n < 10^19


Example


Input

```
19
```



Output

```
22
```
