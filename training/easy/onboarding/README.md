  The Goal
----------


Your program must destroy the enemy ships by shooting the closest enemy on each turn.



  Rules
-------



On each start of turn (within the game loop), you obtain information on the two closest enemies:
* enemy1 and dist1: the name and the distance to enemy 1.
* enemy2 and dist2: the name and the distance to enemy 2.


Before your turn is over (end of the loop), output the value of either enemy1 or enemy2 to shoot the closest enemy.
