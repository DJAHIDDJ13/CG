# Decode the message \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/decode-the-message)\]


Â Goal
-----


As an FBI agent you intercepted a message from terrorists.  
This message has to be decrypted, and to do so you have access to 2 pieces of information : P and C.  
  
C is the alphabet used to write the message, and contains all the letters/characters needed to decode it.  
  
P corresponds to the encoded value of the message.  
Thankfully, you happen to know how this value is computed, and now need to reverse the following process :  
 - Assuming the alphabet is 'abcd', each letter is associated to its index : a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = 3.  
 - For the following values, a new letter is either added or switched :  
 - aa = 4, ba = 5, ca = 6, da = 7  
 - ab = 8, bb = 9, cb = 10, db = 11  
 - ...  
 - aaa = 20, baa = 21, caa = 22, daa = 23, and so on.  
 - The whole message gets a unique value this way. For example with a full alphabet (26 letters) 'hello' would be 7073801.  
  
Get it done agent ! (Good Luck)



Input
first line : an integer P, the encoded value of the message.  
second line : a string C, the alphabet used for the message. Every character in the string is unique, and a space can be one of them.


Output
One line containing the decoded message.


Constraints
0 < P < 10^16


Example


Input

```
35
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
```



Output

```
ja
```
