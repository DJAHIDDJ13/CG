# Equivalent Resistance, Circuit Building \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/equivalent-resistance-circuit-building)\]


 Goal
-----


Calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit containing only resistors.  
  
A resistor is a component used in electrical circuits. A resistor is quantified by its **Resistance**, which is measured in Ohms. We are interested in knowing the total resistance of a circuit of only resistors. There are two key definitions needed to determine the resistance of multiple resistors.   
  
**1. Series**  
  
The resistance of resistors in a line is equivalent to the sum of the resistance of those resistors.  
  

```
    ---[R_1]---[R_2]---
```
  
Resistors in series will be noted with parentheses ( R\_1 R\_2 R\_3 ... and so on ).  
  
The resistance of a series arrangement is: R\_eq = R\_1 + R\_2 + R\_3 + ... and so on, where R\_eq is the equivalent resistance of the series arrangement.  
  
**2. Parallel**  
  
The resistance of resistors in branching paths of the circuit is equal to 1 over the sum of 1 over the resistance of each branching path.  
  

```
       +---[R_1]---+  
       |           |  
    ---+           +---  
       |           |  
       +---[R_2]---+  

```
  
  
Resistors in parallel will be noted with brackets [ R\_1 R\_2 R\_3 ... and so on ].  
  
The resistance of resistors in parallel is R\_eq = 1/(1/R\_1 + 1/R\_2 + 1/R\_3 + 1/... and so on).   
  
A branch can be treated as a single resistor by determining its equivalent resistance.  
  
**Example:**  
  
N = 3  

```
A 24  
B 8  
C 48  
[ ( A B ) [ C A ] ]
```
  
This will look something like this:  
  

```
       +---[C]---+  
       |         |  
    +--+         +--+  
    |  |         |  |  
    |  +---[A]---+  |  
    |               |  
    +---[A]---[B]---+  
    |               |  
    +---[Battery]---+
```
  
[ ( A B ) [ C A ] ] => [ 24+8 1/(1/48+1/24) ] => [ 32 16 ] => 1/(1/32+1/16) => 32/3 => 10.666... => 10.7



Input
**Line 1:** An integer N for the number of unique resistors present in the circuit  
**Next N lines:** A space separated name and the integer resistance R of a resistor  
**Last line:** A space separated combination of parentheses, brackets, and names of resistors


Output
The equivalent resistance expressed as a float rounded to the nearest 0.1 Ohms.


Constraints
0 < N < 10  
0 < R < 100


Example


Input

```
2
A 20
B 10
( A B )
```



Output

```
30.0
```
