# Master of Mayhem \[[link](https://www.codingame.com/training/easy/master-of-mayhem)\]


 Goal
-----


The Master of Mayhem has unleashed a crew of cyborgs on the city, and may be disguised as one - but which one?  
  
From surveillance reports we have determined that each cyborg is wearing a  
hat and some neckwear, and has a companion and a catchphrase.  
  
If Mayhem's hat is a **FEDORA**, then a cyborg wearing a **BEANIE** hat can't be the disguise.   
If you can eliminate all but one cyborg, that's Mayhem!  
  
Mayhem has only been heard to utter one word from a catchphrase.  
  
We might not know all the attributes of either Mayhem or the cyborgs.  
  
Information about Mayhem and the cyborgs always follows one of these formats:  
  
Name's attribute is a string  
Name's attribute is an string  
Name's attribute is "string"  
  
A string contains only letters and spaces.



Input
**Line 1:** An integer N for the number of cyborgs  
**Next N lines:** Cyborg names  
**Next line:** An integer M for the number of reports about Mayhem  
**Next M lines:** Reports about Mayhem in random order  
**Next line:** An integer C for the number of reports about the cyborgs  
**Next C lines:** Reports about the cyborgs in random order


Output
**Line 1:** The name of the only cyborg that could be Mayhem in disguise.  
If none of the listed cyborgs could be Mayhem, output MISSING  
If more than one cyborg could be Mayhem, output INDETERMINATE


Constraints
1 <= N <= 10  
0 <= M <= 4  
0 <= C <= 40
